# solo

My fork of the [Nikola lotabout theme](https://themes.getnikola.com/v7/lotabout/)
with a [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) color theme. Note: I started with
the [hugo blank theme](https://github.com/vimux/blank/) as a base.

For an example of a site built with this theme, checkout [gathuru.xyz](https://www.gathuru.xyz/).

## Installation
In your Hugo site directory, run:
```
git clone https://github.com/eggathuru/hugo-theme-solo themes/solo
```

Set the theme option in `config.yaml` to `solo`.
```
theme: "solo"
```

## License
This theme is released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/eggathuru/hugo-theme-solo/blob/main/LICENSE).
